## Project Overview

The Motor Vehicle Registration System is designed to automate the process of registering motor vehicles at the DLTC. It supports functionalities such as:

- Adding new vehicle records
- Retrieving vehicle and owner information
- Updating registration details
- Deleting outdated records
- Generating reports for administrative purposes

## Features

- **Vehicle Registration**: Register new vehicles with owner details, vehicle type, registration number, and more.
- **Data Storage**: Uses MongoDB to store vehicle and owner information securely.
- **Search Functionality**: Easily search for registered vehicles using license plates, owner's name, or vehicle type.
- **Report Generation**: Generate reports on vehicle registrations for specific dates or types.
- **REST API**: Access system features through a REST API for integration with other systems.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Backend logic and API development.
- **Flask**: Web framework for building the REST API.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing vehicle and owner information.
- **Pymongo**: Python driver for MongoDB to connect and perform database operations.
- **Postman** (optional): For testing the API endpoints.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)
- [Pip (Python package installer)](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/motor-vehicle-registration.git
   cd motor-vehicle-registration
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Required Packages**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set Up MongoDB**

   Make sure MongoDB is running on your system. By default, it runs on `localhost:27017`.

5. **Configure Environment Variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:

   ```env
   MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/dltc_db
   SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
   ```

6. **Run the Application**

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   The server should now be running on `http://localhost:5000`.

## Usage

### Register a New Vehicle

- Use a tool like Postman or `curl` to send a POST request to the `/register` endpoint.

   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/register -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
     "owner_name": "John Doe",
     "vehicle_type": "Sedan",
     "license_plate": "ABC1234",
     "registration_date": "2024-11-10",
     "contact_number": "1234567890"
   }'
   ```

### Get Vehicle Information

- Send a GET request to the `/vehicle/<license_plate>` endpoint:

   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:5000/vehicle/ABC1234
   ```

### Update Vehicle Details

- Use the `/update/<license_plate>` endpoint with a PATCH request.

   ```bash
   curl -X PATCH http://localhost:5000/update/ABC1234 -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
     "contact_number": "0987654321"
   }'
   ```

### Delete a Vehicle Record

- Send a DELETE request to the `/delete/<license_plate>` endpoint:

   ```bash
   curl -X DELETE http://localhost:5000/delete/ABC1234
   ```

## Database Structure

The MongoDB database (`dltc_db`) contains a single collection named `vehicles` with the following structure:

```json
{
  "_id": "ObjectId",
  "owner_name": "John Doe",
  "vehicle_type": "Sedan",
  "license_plate": "ABC1234",
  "registration_date": "2024-11-10",
  "contact_number": "1234567890"
}
```

## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint                    | Description                     |
|--------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|
| POST   | `/register`                | Register a new vehicle          |
| GET    | `/vehicle/<license_plate>` | Get details of a specific vehicle |
| PATCH  | `/update/<license_plate>`  | Update vehicle information      |
| DELETE | `/delete/<license_plate>`  | Delete a vehicle record         |
